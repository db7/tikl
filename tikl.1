.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tikl
("Tikl ist kein Lit") is a compact regression-test driver inspired by LLVM's lit.
It understands the familiar \fB// RUN:\fR style annotations found in many
compiler
projects but keeps the implementation intentionally small and mostly vibe-coded.
Each input file is scanned for directive comments that describe which shell
commands to execute and which feature gates should apply before running them.
.PP
By default the tool prints a compact status line for every test:
\fB[ RUN ]\fR when starting, optionally \fB[ SKIP ]\fR when a feature gate
excludes the test, \fB[FAIL]\fR when a command exits non-zero, \fB[TIME]\fR on a
timeout, and \fB[  OK ]\fR when a test succeeds.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Show each shell command before it runs.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode; only display failures and summary status.
.TP
.BI \-c " file"
Read additional substitution keys from \fIfile\fR. Each line should be
\fIkey\fR = \fIvalue\fR and makes \fB%key\fR available inside directives.
.TP
.BI \-D " feature"
Enable a feature so directives guarded by \fBREQUIRES:\fR or \fBUNSUPPORTED:\fR
can include or skip the current test.
.TP
.BI \-t " seconds"
Kill individual \fBRUN:\fR commands that exceed the given wall-clock limit.
The wrapper exits with status 124 when a timeout occurs.
.TP
.BI \-T " dir"
Use \fIdir\fR as the root for scratch files associated with the \fB%t\fR and
\fB%T\fR placeholders. Defaults to \fI/tmp\fR.
.TP
.BI \-b " dir"
Store paths produced for the \fB%b\fR/\fB%B\fR placeholders under \fIdir\fR
instead of the default \fIbin\fR tree.
.TP
.B \-L
Force FileCheck/lit-compatible behaviour in the helper. `%placeholder`
expansion inside `CHECK` directives is disabled and regex metacharacters must be
escaped explicitly, matching lit's defaults.
.TP
.B \-V
Print the tikl version and exit.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The default configuration maps \fB%check\fR to \fBtikl-check %s\fR, assuming
\fBtikl-check\fR is available on \fBPATH\fR. Additional placeholders come from
files supplied with \fB-c\fR, using simple \fIkey\fR = \fIvalue\fR lines. For
example:
.PP
.nf
    cc = cc -O2 -g
    linker = cc -Wl,-rpath=%T -o %b %s
.fi
.PP
This makes \fB%cc\fR and \fB%linker\fR available inside \fBRUN:\fR directives.
.SH DIRECTIVES
tikl recognises the following case-sensitive directives inside line comments:
.TP
\fBRUN:\fR command
Collects the shell \fIcommand\fR to execute for the current test.
.TP
\fBREQUIRES:\fR feature[, feature...]
Skips the test unless every listed feature is supplied with \fB-D\fR.
.TP
\fBUNSUPPORTED:\fR feature[, feature...]
Skips the test when any listed feature is enabled.
.TP
\fBALLOW_RETRIES:\fR count
Retries each \fBRUN:\fR command up to \fIcount\fR additional times when it
fails or times out. The allowance applies per step.
.TP
\fBXFAIL:\fR [reason]
Marks the test as an expected failure. tikl reports \[lq]XFAIL\[rq] when a
step fails (or times out) and treats the test as passed. If every step
succeeds, the run is flagged as \[lq]XPASS\[rq] and fails overall. An optional
\fIreason\fR after the colon is printed alongside the status.
.SH PLACEHOLDERS
Substitutions available inside \fBRUN:\fR commands:
.TP
\fB%s\fR
Current test file path.
.TP
\fB%S\fR
Directory containing the current test.
.TP
\fB%t\fR
Per-command scratch file (unique for the run).
.TP
\fB%T\fR
Scratch directory matching \fB%t\fR.
.TP
\fB%b\fR
Path that mirrors the source layout under the directory supplied with
\fB-b\fR (defaults to \fBbin\fR).
.TP
\fB%B\fR
Directory component of \fB%b\fR.
.PP
User-defined placeholders come from the configuration file supplied with
\fB-c\fR. For example, \fBcc = cc -O2 -g\fR makes \fB%cc\fR available. The
\fB%check\fR placeholder resolves to \fBtikl-check %s\fR by default and can be
overridden the same way. The helper recognises \fBCHECK:\fR, \fBCHECK-NOT:\fR,
\fBCHECK-NEXT:\fR, \fBCHECK-SAME:\fR, \fBCHECK-EMPTY:\fR, and \fBCHECK-COUNT:\fR
directives. Plain \fBCHECK:\fR patterns must appear in order. \fBCHECK-NEXT:\fR
advances to the following output line, \fBCHECK-SAME:\fR stays on the current
line, \fBCHECK-EMPTY:\fR demands a blank line, \fBCHECK-NOT:\fR forbids the
fragment anywhere, and \fBCHECK-COUNT:\fR enforces an exact occurrence count.
Passing \fB--check-prefix=ALT\fR (repeatable) after \fB%check\fR switches the
accepted prefixes to \fBALT\fR, \fBALT-NEXT\fR, and so on.
Regex fragments can be embedded inline with \fB{{...}}\fR; surrounding text is
still matched literally.
.SH CHECK DIRECTIVES
The `tikl-check` helper deliberately deviates from LLVM FileCheck in three ways:
.IP 1.
`%placeholder` tokens (from `tikl.conf` or built-ins such as `%s`, `%S`, `%b`,
and `%B`) are expanded inside every `CHECK` variant. Write `%%name` to keep a
literal percent sequence.
.IP 2.
Literal text outside `{{...}}` regex blocks is treated verbatim, so characters
like `(` or `)` no longer require escaping.
.IP 3.
Inline helper expressions `%(basename ARG)` / `%(realpath ARG)` run inside
`CHECK` patterns, allowing quick path manipulation without shell glue.
.PP
These conveniences speed up authoring, but pass `-L` to `tikl` when you need
strict FileCheck compatibility—every deviation (including the helpers) is
disabled and regex metacharacters regain their default meaning. Regardless of
mode you can use `--check-prefix` after `%check` to select alternate directive
tags.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The snippet below builds a small helper, runs it, and checks the produced
output with the default \fB%check\fR expansion:
.PP
.nf
    // RUN: %cc %s -o %b
    // RUN: %b | %check
    // CHECK: expected content

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        printf("expected content\\n");
        return 0;
    }
.fi
.PP
Tests can also assert that a binary fails while still validating its diagnostic
stream. Wrapping the invocation in \fB(! ...)\fR flips the exit code so the
overall command succeeds when the program aborts:
.PP
.nf
    // RUN: %cc %s -o %b
    // RUN: (! %b) 2>&1 | %check
    // CHECK: boom assertion triggered

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int main(void) {
        fprintf(stderr, "boom assertion triggered\\n");
        abort();
    }
.fi
.SH EXIT STATUS
Zero on success, non-zero on failure. A timed-out command returns exit status
124.
